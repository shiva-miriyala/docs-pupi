title: Define routes
updated: 2023-12-07

## Objective  

You might need to control how people access your web applications,
for example when you have [multiple apps](../create-apps/create-apps-multi-app) in one project.
Or you might just want to direct requests to specific places, such as removing the `www` at the start of all requests.


<!-- Web PaaS configuration-->
Control where external requests are directed by defining routes in a `{{< vendor/configfile "routes" >}}` file in your Git repository.
