## Objective  

All of our Dedicated clusters are monitored 24/7 to ensure uptime and to measure server metrics such as available disk space, memory and disk usage, and several dozen other metrics that give us a complete picture of the health of your application’s infrastructure.

For more information, see which [monitoring systems](../../dedicated-gen-3/dedicated-gen-3-monitoring) Web PaaS uses to [monitor application performance](../../dedicated-gen-3/dedicated-gen-3-monitoring#application-performance-monitoring)
and detect [availability incidents](../../dedicated-gen-3/monitoring.md#availability-incident-handling-procedure)
on both {{% names/dedicated-gen-2 %}} and {{% names/dedicated-gen-3 %}} projects.
