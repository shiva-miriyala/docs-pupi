## Objective  

To delete a project, you must be an organization owner or have the [manage plans permission](../administration/users.md#organization-permissions).

To delete a Web PaaS project, including all data, code, and active environments:

> [!tabs]      
> In the Console     
>> ```      
>> {!> web/web-paas/ !}  
>> ```     
> Using the CLI     
>> ```      
>> {!> web/web-paas/ !}  
>> ```     

You are billed only for the portion of a month when the project was active.

When you remove all your projects from your user account,
you stop being charged.
