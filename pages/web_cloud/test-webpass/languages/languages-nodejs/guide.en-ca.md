## Objective  

Node.js is a popular asynchronous JavaScript runtime.
Deploy scalable Node.js apps of all sizes on Web PaaS.
You can also develop a microservice architecture mixing JavaScript and other apps with [multi-app projects](../../create-apps/create-apps-multi-app).

## Supported versions

{{% major-minor-versions-note %}}




<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Grid and {{% names/dedicated-gen-3 %}}</th>
            <th>Dedicated Gen 2</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>20 |  
|  18 |  
|  16</td>
            <td>None available</thd>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>



### Specify the language

To use Node.js, specify nodejs as your [app's `nodejs`](/create-apps/app-reference.html#nodejss):



```yaml {configFile="app"}
type: 'nodejs:<VERSION_NUMBER>'
```

For example:

```yaml {configFile="app"}
type: 'nodejs:20'
```



To use a specific version in a container with a different language, [use a version manager](../../node-version).

### Deprecated versions
 The following versions are deprecated. They're available, but they aren't receiving security updates from upstream and aren't guaranteed to work. They'll be removed in the future, so migrate to one of the [supported versions](#supported-versions).




<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Grid</th>
            <th>Dedicated Gen 2</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>14 |  
|  12 |  
|  10 |  
|  8 |  
|  6 |  
|  4.8 |  
|  4.7 |  
|  0.12</td>
            <td>14 |  
|  12 |  
|  10 |  
|  8 |  
|  6 |  
|  4.8 |  
|  4.7 |  
|  0.12</thd>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>



## Usage example

To use JavaScript with Node.js on Web PaaS, configure your [app configuration](../../create-apps)
(a complete example is included at the end).

### 1. Specify the version

Choose a version from the [list of supported versions](#supported-versions)
and add it to your app configuration:



```yaml {configFile="app"}
type: 'nodejs:20'
```



### 2. Specify any global dependencies

Add the following to your app configuration:




```yaml {configFile="app"}
type: 'nodejs:20'
dependencies:
    nodejs:
        sharp: "*"
```



These are now available as commands, the same as installing with `npm install -g`.

### 3. Build your app

Include any commands needed to build and setup your app in the `hooks`, as in the following example:



```yaml {configFile="app"}
type: 'nodejs:20'
dependencies:
    nodejs:
        sharp: "*"
hooks:
    build: |
        npm run setup-assets
        npm run build
```



### 4. Start your app

Specify a command to start serving your app (it must be a process running in the foreground):



```yaml {configFile="app"}
type: 'nodejs:20'
dependencies:
    nodejs:
        sharp: "*"
hooks:
    build: |
        npm run setup-assets
        npm run build
web:
    commands:
        start: node index.js
```



### 5. Listen on the right port


Make sure your Node.js application is configured to listen over the port given by the environment.
The following example uses the [`platformsh-config` helper](#configuration-reader):

```js
// Load the http module to create an http server.
const http = require('http');

// Load the Web PaaS configuration
const config = require('platformsh-config').config();

const server = http.createServer(function (request, response) {
    response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "application/json"});
    response.end("Hello world!");
});

// Listen on the port from the Web PaaS configuration
server.listen(config.port);
```


### Complete example

A complete basic app configuration looks like the following:



```yaml {configFile="app"}
name: node-app

type: 'nodejs:20'

disk: 512

dependencies:
    nodejs:
        sharp: "*"

hooks:
    build: |
        npm run setup-assets
        npm run build

web:
    commands:
        start: "node index.js"
```



## Dependencies

By default, Web PaaS assumes you're using npm as a package manager.
If your code has a `package.json`, the following command is run as part of the default [build flavor](../../create-apps/app-reference.md#build):

```bash
npm prune --userconfig .npmrc && npm install --userconfig .npmrc
```

This means you can specify configuration in a `.npmrc` file in [your app root](../../create-apps/app-reference.md#root-directory).

### Use Yarn as a package manager

To switch to Yarn to manage dependencies, follow these steps:

1\. Turn off the default use of npm:




```yaml {configFile="app"}
   build:
       flavor: none
```



2\. Specify the version of Yarn you want:


```json {location="package.json"}
{
  ...
  "packageManager": "yarn@3.2.1"
}
```

What you do next depends on the versions of Yarn and Node.js you want.
